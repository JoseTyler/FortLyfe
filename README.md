My Project 3 is titled FORTLYFE

The idea is for Fortnite players to have a site where they can post their gaming information that will allow other teams to view them and possibly add them to their team.

The 1st model will display a form where players can submit their "Gamer Tag, Name, Age, & Platform".
Once they submit the form, a page displaying all "freeagents" information will show.

The 2nd model will allow players to add their gamertags & upload Youtube links to show visitors how good their gameplay really is.
Once they submit their video, a page will open displaying all videos that have been added previously along with their gamertags.
