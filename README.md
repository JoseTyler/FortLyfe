My Project 3 is titled FORTLYFE

The idea is for Fortnite players to have a site where they can post their gaming information that will allow other teams to view them and possibly add them to their team.

The 1st model will display a form where players can add thier "Gamer Tag, Name, Age, & Platform"

The 2nd model will allow players to upload Youtube links to show visitors how good thier gameplay really is
